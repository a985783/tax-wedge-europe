# Journal Shortlist & Matching Strategy

## Tier A: Top Field (Public Finance / Macro)
**Target:** *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy (AEJ: Policy)* or *Journal of Public Economics (JPubE)*

*   **Match Reason:**
    *   **AEJ: Policy:** Favors clean identification strategies applied to relevant policy questions. The "Tax Wedge" methodology is a strong selling point as a new tool for policy analysis. The results on VAT cuts (often used as stimulus) are directly relevant to policymakers.
    *   **JPubE:** The natural home for tax incidence papers. The "rockets and feathers" result in taxation is a classic public finance topic. The extensive cross-country data fits their preference for broad empirical evidence.
*   **Key Preference:** Both journals value "clean identification" and "policy relevance". They will scrutinize the exogeneity of the tax shocks (hence the emphasis on the "Clean Window" and parallel trends).
*   **Risks:** They might demand a more structural model to explain *why* the asymmetry exists (e.g., search costs, fairness).

## Tier B: General Interest / Macro
**Target:** *European Economic Review (EER)* or *Journal of Money, Credit and Banking (JMCB)*

*   **Match Reason:**
    *   **EER:** High interest in European data and EU-wide studies. Since the paper covers 30 European countries, it's a perfect geographic fit.
    *   **JMCB:** Focuses on macro-money/inflation. The implications for inflation dynamics and central bank monitoring make it suitable.
*   **Key Preference:** Robust empirical facts. EER loves cross-country European studies. JMCB will care about the inflation persistence implications.
*   **Risks:** EER might find the methodology "standard" (event study) even if the data is new. JMCB might ask for a DSGE model implementation.

## Tier C: Specialized / Regional
**Target:** *International Tax and Public Finance (ITPF)* or *Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics*

*   **Match Reason:**
    *   **ITPF:** Specialized in tax policy; Benedek et al. (2020) published there. Solid fall-back if top journals want more theoretical innovation.
    *   **Oxford Bulletin:** Excellent for applied econometrics and empirical papers with strong data work but less theoretical novelty.
*   **Key Preference:** Solid execution, correct econometrics.
*   **Risks:** Lower visibility/impact factor.

## Submission Strategy
1.  **Start with AEJ: Policy**. The policy implication of "ineffective VAT cuts" is a strong hook.
2.  **If desk rejected (no review), go to JPubE**.
3.  **If rejected after review**, address comments and target **EER**.

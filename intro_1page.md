# The Tax Wedge: Symmetric Pass-through of Indirect Taxes in Europe
## One-Page Introduction Summary

**Motivation & Puzzle**
Indirect taxes (VAT, excise) are a cornerstone of EU fiscal policy, yet their impact on consumer prices remains debated. A central puzzle in macroeconomics is "rockets and feathers"—the notion that prices rise quickly with tax hikes but fall slowly with cuts (asymmetric pass-through). Understanding this asymmetry is crucial for assessing the efficacy of temporary VAT cuts as stimulus tools.

**The "Macro-Micro" Gap**
Existing research suffers from a trade-off: macro studies lack identification due to endogeneity, while micro studies lack external validity. Manually collecting tax data across 30 countries is prohibitively costly, leading to a scarcity of comprehensive, high-frequency evidence.

**Methodological Innovation: The "Tax Wedge"**
We bridge this gap by constructing a novel "Tax Wedge" indicator. We exploit the mechanical accounting identity between the standard HICP and the HICP at Constant Tax Rates (HICP-CT). By differencing these series, we automate the detection of idiosyncratic tax shocks across 30 European countries (1996-2024) without relying on legislative texts, and validate a stratified sample against Eurostat metadata.

**Key Findings**
1.  **Symmetric Pass-through**: Contrary to the "rockets and feathers" hypothesis, we find **no evidence of asymmetry**. Prices respond to tax cuts just as rapidly and completely as they do to hikes. The pass-through elasticity is ~0.35 on impact and ~0.35 after one year.
2.  **Heterogeneity**:
    *   **Core vs. Periphery**: Pass-through is robust in Core Europe but muted in Peripheral economies.
    *   **Goods Type**: Pass-through is nearly complete for Non-durables (Food, Energy) but low for Durables.

**Mechanism & Implications**
We argue that the high degree of competition in the European Single Market and the salience of tax-inclusive pricing force firms to adjust prices symmetrically. This validates the use of temporary VAT cuts as an effective demand-side stimulus, as savings are passed on to consumers rather than captured as margins. Our baseline uses a stacked event-study with explicit control groups, calendar month fixed effects, and event fixed effects.

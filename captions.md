# Figures and Tables Captions

**Figure 1: Dynamic Pass-through of Indirect Tax Shocks (Pooled Sample)**
*Notes*: This figure plots the coefficients $\beta_\tau$ from the stacked event study specification: $\ln P_{c,k,t} - \ln P_{c,k,t^*_e-1} = \sum \beta_\tau \mathbb{1}[t - t^*_e = \tau] \cdot \text{Size}_{e} + \mu + \lambda + \varepsilon$. The sample includes all identified tax shocks $>1\%$ in the EU-30 from 1996 to 2024, excluding confounding events within a $\pm 3$ month window. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval clustered at the country level. The results show a sharp, immediate price adjustment at $t=0$ followed by stabilization, with no significant pre-trends ($t<0$).

**Figure 2: Heterogeneity by Region: Core vs. Periphery**
*Notes*: The figure displays event study coefficients estimated separately for "Core" economies (Germany, France, Benelux, etc.) and "Periphery" economies (Greece, Portugal, Eastern Europe). Core economies exhibit stable, positive pass-through (~0.5), while Peripheral economies show significantly weaker and more volatile responses, suggesting lower pricing power or demand constraints in these markets.

**Figure 3: Heterogeneity by Product Durability**
*Notes*: The figure contrasts the pass-through dynamics for Non-durable goods (Food, Energy) versus Durable goods (Furniture, Appliances). Non-durables show high, potentially over-shifted pass-through (>0.8), consistent with inelastic demand. Durables show significantly lower pass-through (<0.3), consistent with higher demand elasticity and competitive absorption of tax shocks.

**Figure 4: Testing for Asymmetry: Tax Hikes vs. Tax Cuts**
*Notes*: This figure plots the dynamic response to Tax Hikes ($\text{Size}_e > 0$, blue line) and Tax Cuts ($\text{Size}_e < 0$, red line). The dependent variable is normalized so that both responses are positive for visual comparison. The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The overlap between the two series indicates **symmetric pass-through**, rejecting the "rockets and feathers" hypothesis of downward price rigidity.

**Table 1: Baseline Regression Results**
*Notes*: The table reports point estimates for the cumulative pass-through elasticity at $t=0$ (Impact) and $t=12$ (Long-run). Columns (1)-(3) vary the fixed effect structure. All specifications include event-specific unit and time fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. *** p<0.01.

**Table B1: Robustness to Alternative Clustering**
*Notes*: This table compares standard errors under different clustering levels: Country (Baseline), Country-Year, and Country-Product. The significance of the main coefficients remains robust across all specifications.

**Table B2: Robustness to Event Window Size**
*Notes*: This table reports pass-through estimates using event windows of $\pm 6$, $\pm 12$, and $\pm 24$ months. The stability of the coefficients at longer horizons confirms that the identified effects are permanent.

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript entitled "The Tax Wedge: High-Frequency Identification of Indirect Tax Shocks and Price Rigidity in Europe" for consideration for publication in *The Review of Economics and Statistics*.

This paper addresses a fundamental question in public finance and macroeconomics: how do prices respond to indirect tax changes, and is this response symmetric? While fiscal policy relies heavily on indirect taxes, identifying their causal impact is confounded by the endogeneity of reforms and the scarcity of high-frequency legislative data.

**Key Contributions:**
1.  **Methodological Innovation**: We introduce the "Tax Wedge" indicator, leveraging the mechanical divergence between HICP and HICP-at-Constant-Tax-Rates to automate the detection of over 20,000 tax shocks across 30 European countries (1996–2024). This bridges the gap between narrative identification (Romer & Romer, 2010) and large-scale statistical analysis.
2.  **Empirical Evidence against "Rockets and Feathers"**: Contrary to the prevalent view of asymmetric price adjustment (Benzarti et al., 2020), we find robust evidence of **symmetric pass-through** in the broad European market. Prices fall as fast as they rise.
3.  **Mechanism**: We show that this symmetry is driven by intense competition in the goods market (tradables) and the high salience of VAT changes in Europe. We document significant heterogeneity, with pass-through being nearly complete for non-durables in core economies but muted in peripheral economies.

We believe this paper is a strong fit for *Restat* because it combines a novel identification strategy with massive micro-level evidence to revisit a classic theoretical prediction. The findings have direct implications for the design of fiscal stimulus packages, suggesting that temporary VAT cuts are more effective than previously thought.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. I declare no conflicts of interest.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
